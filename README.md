# Soil Moisture Detection System with Rain Enhancement

**Summary:**

This project implements an IoT system for monitoring soil moisture levels with the enhancement of rain detection. The system measures and logs soil moisture percentages before and after rainfall events. The collected data is then compared to analyze the impact of rain on soil moisture levels. A user-friendly dashboard is created on Vone IoT Cloud to visualize the data in real-time. Additionally, an email alert system is integrated to notify users when new data is received on the cloud.

**Features:**

* Soil moisture level measurement and logging
* Rain detection and logging
* Comparison of soil moisture levels before and after rain
* Real-time data visualization on Vone IoT Cloud dashboard
* Email alerts for new data received

**Technology Stack:**

* **Hardware:**
    * Soil moisture sensor
    * Rain sensor
    * Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
    * Wi-Fi module
* **Software:**
    * Vone IoT Cloud platform
    * Programming language (e.g., C/C++, Python)
    * Email library (e.g., SMTP)

**Installation and Setup:**

1. **Hardware Setup:**
    * Assemble the hardware components according to the circuit diagram.
    * Connect the sensors to the microcontroller.
    * Configure the Wi-Fi module for network connectivity.
2. **Software Setup:**
    * Create a Vone IoT Cloud account.
    * Create a device and data streams for soil moisture and rain data.
    * Install the necessary libraries in Arduino.
    * Develop and upload the code to the microcontroller.
3. **Dashboard Configuration:**
    * Design the dashboard on Vone IoT Cloud using widgets to display soil moisture data, and rain data.
    * Configure the email alert system to send notifications to the specified email address.

**Usage:**

1. **Data Collection:** The system will continuously measure and log soil moisture and rain data.
2. **Data Analysis:** The system will compare soil moisture levels before and after rain events to analyze the impact of rainfall.
3. **Dashboard Visualization:** The Vone IoT Cloud dashboard will display real-time data.
4. **Email Alerts:** Users will receive email notifications when new data is received on the cloud.
